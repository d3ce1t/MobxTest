The second computed value depends on the first one. Everything works as expected when the computed values return observables. If computed values return an array, abnormal behaviour is produced, i.e. sorting stops working, filtered values get sorted and reactions in autorun are not triggered as expected.</p><p>So the questions are:<ol><li><strong>Should computed values return observables?</strong></li><li><strong>Why this example doesn't work when computed values return an Array?</strong></li></ol></p><p><strong>UPDATE: It was my mistake. I employed Array.sort() which performs in-place sorting. Due to this, cache of filtered computed value was being modified.</strong></p><div id="root"></div><h3><a href="https://github.com/d3ce1t/MobxTest/blob/master/src/index.js">Source code</a></h3><h3><a href="https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx/issues/883">Github issue</a></h3><script type="text/javascript" src="/MobxTest/static/js/main.296e0c4c.js"></script></body></html>
